**Permission Summary** is an Android app that gives you a clear, organized overview of which apps
have access to sensitive permissions on your device.

> ⚠️ This app only lists **dangerous permissions** and only for **non-system (user-installed) apps**.

Built with Jetpack Compose, Material 3, and modern Android architecture.
